`next` <br> `n` <br> `next `number  | Execute next line of code. Will not enter functions. 
`until` <br> `until `line-number  | Continue processing until you reach a specified line number. <br>Also: function name, address, filename:function or filename:line-number.

`up` <br> `down` <br> `up `number <br> `down `number  | Move up a single frame (element in the call stack)<br>Move down a single frame<br>Move up/down the specified number of frames in the stack.
`info frame` | List address, language, address of arguments/local variables and which registers were saved in frame.
`info args` <br> `info locals` <br> `info catch` | Info arguments of selected frame, local variables and exception handlers.
⠀|⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀**Source Code**
`list` <br> `l` <br> `list `line-number <br> `list `function <br> `list -` <br> `list `start#`,`end# <br> `list `filename`:`function | List source code.
`set listsize `count <br> `show listsize` | Number of lines listed when `list command` given.
`directory `directory-name <br> `dir `directory-name <br> `show directories` | Add specified directory to front of source code path.
`directory` | Clear sourcepath when nothing specified.
⠀|⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀**Machine Language**
`info line` <br> `info line `number  | Displays the start and end position in object code for the current line in source.<br>Display position in object code for a specified line in source.
`disassemble `0xstart 0xend | Displays machine code for positions in object code specified (can use start and end hex memory values given by the `info line` command.

`x `0xaddress <br> `x/nfu `0xaddress  | Examine the contents of memory.<br>Examine the contents of memory and specify formatting.<ul><li>n: number of display items to print</li><li>f: specify the format for the output</li><li>u: specify the size of the data unit (eg. byte, word, ...)</li></ul>Example: `x/4dw var`
⠀|⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀**Examine Variables**
`print `variable-name <br> `p `variable-name <br> `p `file-name`::`variable-name <br> `p '`file-name`'::`variable-name  | Print value stored in variable.
`p *`array-variable`@`length  | Print first # values of array specified by `length`. Good for pointers to dynamicaly allocated memory.
`p/x `variable  | Print as integer variable in hex.
`p/d `variable  | Print variable as a signed integer.
`p/u `variable  | Print variable as a un-signed integer.
`p/o `variable  | Print variable as a octal.
`p/t `variable <br> `x/b `address <br> `x/b &`variable  | Print as integer value in binary. (1 byte/8bits)
`p/c `variable  | Print integer as character.

`p/a `variable  | Print as a hex address.
`x/w `address <br> `x/4b &`variable  | Print binary representation of 4 bytes (1 32 bit word) of memory pointed to by address.
`ptype `variable <br> `ptype `data-type  | Prints type definition of the variable or declared variable type. Helpful for viewing class or struct definitions while debugging.
⠀|⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀**GDB Modes**
`set `gdb-option value  | Set a GDB option
`set logging on` <br> `set logging off` <br> `show logging` <br> `set logging file `log-file | Turn on/off logging. Default name of file is `gdb.txt`

`set print pretty on` <br> `set print pretty off` <br> `show print pretty` | Format printing of C structures.
`set print union on` <br> `set print union off` <br> `show print union` | Default is on. Print C unions.
`set print demangle on` <br> `set print demangle off` <br> `show print demangle` | Default on. Controls printing of C++ names.
⠀|⠀⠀⠀⠀⠀**Start and Stop**
`run` <br> `r` <br> `run `command-line-arguments <br> `run <`infile`> `outfile  | Start program execution from the beginning of the program. <br>The command `break main` will get you started. Also allows basic I/O redirection.
