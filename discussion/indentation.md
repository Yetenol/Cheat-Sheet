## Spaces
- A tab could be a different number of columns depending on your environment, but a space is always one column.
- In terms of how many spaces (or tabs) constitutes indentation, it's more important to be consistent throughout your code than to use any specific tab stop value.


## Tabs

- They're a character specifically meant for indentation
- They allow developers with different preferences in indentation size to change how it's the code looks without changing the code (separation of data and presentation for the proverbial win!)
- It's impossible to half-indent something with tabs. So when you copy code from some website that used 3 spaces into your 4-space indented file, you don't have to deal with misalignment.
- allow mistakes to be more noticeable, it's annoying to micro manage to spaces.
- are consistent, they are only used for indentation, unless you are commenting wrong.
- are customizable, you can specify in the options of the editor how wide they are.
- are more productive, why type 4 spaces when ye can hit 1 tab.
- take less size than multiple spaces.
- take more space than a space.
- take less time to go through.
- tend to work better in IDEs.
